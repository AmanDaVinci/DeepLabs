- Understanding the effect of Activations or addition of non-linearity in neural networks.

Acitvations smoothen the linear functions which are sharp lines with sudden step changes on the edge. The partial derivative at these points are undefined. However, the smoothing curve makes the partial derivatives existent which help the back propagation to train the network.
