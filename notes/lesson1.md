## Key Points
---
- The notebooks have extra information and they let us experiment. Experimenting is the secret to developing a strong intuition for deep learning architectures and training!

- Learn on "as needed" basis. Do the entire course as fast as possible, then revisit again and again.

- CNN Image -> Structured Neural Network -> Language RNN -> Collaborative filtering intro -> Collaborative filtering in depth -> Structured Neural Network in depth -> CNN in depth -> Language RNN in depth

- Arthur Samuel did first machine learning with the checkers program that defeated himself. He had this idea of writing software through learning: Differential Learning

- Machine learning takes a lot of feature engineering and domain expertise

- Deep Learing: Infinitely flexible function (Universal Approximator Function), all-purpose parameter tuning (Gradient Descent Backpropagation), fast & scalable (GPU). Neural Network: non-linear function composed of cap Sigma, cap Pi and sigmoid function

- [IMP] Single hidden layer neural networks require exponentially huge number of parameters (neurons) to learn a function; however, with multiple hidden layers we get super linear scaling and that becomes deep learning. This means that it is easier to train a deep network than a shallow network with huge number of neurons.

- Too high learning rate can lead to divergence instead of convergence

- Linear function is anything with straight lines, planes or hyperplanes. The change/slope is always constant. It is a one degree polynomial equation. Matrix multiplications can be modelled as a linear function. However, non-linear functions have non-constant change/slope. It is a higher degree polynomial equation.
