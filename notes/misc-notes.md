## Key Points
---
- data science is different from software engineering; good practices are very different
- machine learning must help us understand as well as predict the data
- structured data for machine learning
- machine learning theory about curse of dimensionality does not hold in practise
- add as many columns as long as they vary
- no free hunch theorem says that a single model cannot work on all random datasets; however, real datasets are not random
- random forest pretty good in almost all datasets, good baseline
- random forest need careful pre-processing
- regression is not linear regression, it is predicting continuous values
- converting to sensible categorical variables eases up the training process
- saving to feathers is the new thing

## TODO
---
- basic cleaning and pre-processing
- explain to others
- use train_cat and apply_cat
- use date feature extraction
